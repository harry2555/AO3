Step by Step Tutuorial on how to connect Git, Github, and Github.
1. Create a github account
2. Downdload git using https://git-scm.com/downloads 
3. Use the correct operating sytem to download the softare and paste it in your terminal. 
4. Follow the directions on the website given above.

7. Click add account, sign into github, specify your credentials. 
8. Add git to Webstorm by clicking settings, choosing git and adding link to terminal. 
Branch:
A branch is a separate version of the same code base. Like a branch on a tree, a branch in Git shares the same trunk as other branches, but is an individual. With branches, the two programmers can work on separate versions of the same website without interfering with each other.
Clone: Website cloning refers to the copying or modification of an existing website design or script to create a new website. Website cloning allows designers to create websites without the need to write scripts from scratch.
Commit:Every time you create a new version of a file, you are making a “commit” to record that in the file version history. Each commit has a message to describe the change. Github suggests a default message (“Create index. html”, in this case), but you can override that by typing in the box.
Fetch:By performing a Git fetch, you are downloading and copying that branch's files to your workstation.
GIT: Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files.
Github:Github is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code.
Merge:joining two or more commit histories
Merge Conflict: A difference that occurs between merged branches.
Push: To push means to send your comitted changes to a remote repository on Github.com
Pull:A Github-specific term to let others know about chnage you've pushed to a branch in a repository
Remote: a secondary copy of a Git repository where you push changes for collaboration or backup 
Repository:where you keep yout copy of a Git repository on your workstation
